I am a PhD student studying with [Yuan Zhou](https://www.ms.uky.edu/~yzh392/) at the [University of Kentucky](https://math.as.uky.edu/). My research is in understanding heuristics for general-purpose cutting planes for integer and mixed-integer programs from Gomory's master group relaxation. Broadly, I'm interested in combinatorics, discrete optimization, and computational game theory.

Before graduate school, I got my bachelor's degree at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in computer science and mathematics. In 2021, I did an REU there with [Isaac MacArthur](https://www.umass.edu/mathematics-statistics/about/directory/isaac-macarthur) under the advising of [Alejandro Morales](https://ahmorales.combinatoria.co/) in Ehrhart theory and flow polytopes.
