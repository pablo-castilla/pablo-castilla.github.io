I am a PhD student studying with [Yuan Zhou](https://www.ms.uky.edu/~yzh392/) at the [University of Kentucky](https://math.as.uky.edu/).

My research is in understanding heuristics for general-purpose cutting planes for integer and mixed-integer programs from Gomory's master group relaxation.

Broadly, I'm interested in combinatorics, discrete optimization, and algorithmic game theory.
