# Hello, Pablo here!
I am a PhD student studying with [Yuan Zhou](https://www.ms.uky.edu/~yzh392/) at the [University of Kentucky](https://math.as.uky.edu/). My research is in understanding heuristics for general-purpose cutting planes for integer and mixed-integer programs from Gomory’s master group relaxation. Broadly, I’m interested in combinatorics, discrete optimization, and computational game theory.

Before graduate school, I got my bachelor’s degree at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in computer science and mathematics. In the summer of 2021, I did an REU there with Isaac MacArthur under the advising of Alejandro Morales in Ehrhart theory and flow polytopes.
In the summer of 2025, I participated in the G-RIPS Berlin program, studying non-rigid reconstruction under topological changes at ZIB with Agniva Sengupta.
